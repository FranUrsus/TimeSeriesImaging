This script implements a methodology that combines ***deep learning***, ***image and time series processing*** to ***predict hourly electricity consumption for the next day***.

The proposed methodology consists of 3 phases:

- **Data preparation**. Prepare the data accordingly to apply the methodology
- **Time series imaging**. Transformation of time series into 2D images suitable for training models with deep learning. 
- **Training of Deep learning models:** Use deep learning algorithms to obtain models capable of predicting the next day's consumption from 2D images of weekly time series.

## Data preparation
  
  The first step consists of preparing a dataset in which each row represents the weekly hourly consumption (24x7) of any user and the cluster (cluster_ next_day) that best represents the next day's (24 hours) consumption for that user. This cluster is assigned by applying a clustering model to the 24 hours of consumption of the next day. This model will be available for free and will be detailed as below.

This figure shows what the data must look like in order to be processed by the script:

> **_NOTE:_** This script does not prepare the data as described.

## Clustering model

The centroids of the model that has been used to assign the next day's cluster to each weekly consumption are as follows:

This model is available for free in model folder.

## Time series imaging

Time series can be modeled as 2D curves representing the value for each instant in the time series, but this way of modelling time series is not the most suitable for training models with deep learning algorithms to make predictions from time series images.

### Week consumption

This figure shows a time series of a user's weekly consumption represented as a curve.

### Consumption centroid

This figure shows a time series of a  consumption centroid represented as a curve.

### Modelling time series images for deep learning model training

To obtain better results in training models based on time series images with deep learning techniques, the time series instead of being modelled as curves (shown above), can be modelled by applying a series of transformations that generate a 2D representation in a specific  domain.
 The proposed methodology will model each weekly consumption time series as an image in the Gramian Angular Field domain.

### Deep learning

  Deep leaning model will be trained by providing as inputs the weekly temporal series modelled as Gramian Angular Field images as can be seen in the figure shown in the previous section.. The neural netorks outputs will be the corresponding label for the consumption cluster for next day.
 
The output of the network will be a one hot encoding vector that will have a value of 1 in the neuron that activates the predicted consumption cluster for the next day. The rest of the unselected clusters will remain at 0.

In this output example, the week consumption image with feed the deep learning model activates the first output neurons (cluster 0 next day consumption will be predicted)

To make predictions using the trained model, the weekly time series to be predicted would be converted to Gramian domain, and the output generated by the neural network will be the next day consumption cluster label.
